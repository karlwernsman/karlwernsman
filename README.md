### Howdy ya'll!

I am a software developer in training at Alchemy Code Lab. My background in human and veterinary healthcare shaped me to be a person with empathy, communication skills, and work-ethic, not only in the workplace but also in my everyday life. I value diversity and inclusion in tech and ensuring a safe space for all in the workplace.
